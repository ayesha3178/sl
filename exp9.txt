Theory Explanation:

What the program does:
This program visualizes the distribution of passenger ages on the Titanic, segmented by gender and survival status, using a boxplot. It helps understand the relationship between age, gender, and survival.

Key operations of the program:
1. **Dataset Loading**: Loads the Titanic dataset using Seabornâ€™s built-in `load_dataset()` method.
2. **Missing Value Handling**: Drops any rows where the age is missing to ensure accuracy in age-based visualization.
3. **Boxplot Visualization**: A boxplot is created to compare age distributions across different genders and survival outcomes.
4. **Plot Customization**: Adds titles, axis labels, and a legend for better readability.

Observations/Conclusions:
- The boxplot allows visual inspection of **age distribution** among males and females, split by whether they survived or not.
- **Median age** and **age variability** can be compared across groups. For example, survivors may show different age tendencies compared to non-survivors.
- It may be observed that **younger females** had higher survival rates compared to older males, aligning with the common "women and children first" evacuation protocol.
- This type of visualization is useful for spotting **outliers**, central tendencies (medians), and interquartile ranges within categorical groups.
