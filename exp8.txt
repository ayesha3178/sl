Theory Explanation:

What the program does:
This program performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Seaborn visualizations. It aims to reveal patterns related to passenger survival, gender, class, and ticket fare.

Key operations of the program:
1. **Data Loading**: The Titanic dataset is loaded using Seabornâ€™s built-in function.
2. **Survival Count by Gender**: A countplot shows how many males and females survived versus did not survive.
3. **Survival Count by Class**: Another countplot illustrates how survival is distributed among different passenger classes (First, Second, Third).
4. **Fare Distribution**: A histogram with a KDE line shows how ticket prices are distributed among the passengers.

Observations/Conclusions:
- From the gender-based survival count, it can be observed that **females had a significantly higher survival rate than males**, reflecting the "women and children first" evacuation policy.
- The class-based survival count reveals that **first-class passengers had the highest survival rate**, while third-class passengers had the lowest.
- The fare distribution histogram indicates a **right-skewed distribution**, suggesting that most passengers paid lower fares, but a few paid very high amounts.
- These visual insights are crucial for understanding how different features relate to survival and can guide further predictive modeling or hypothesis testing.
