import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# 2. Load the Iris dataset from a local CSV file
df = pd.read_csv("iris.csv")  # Make sure iris.csv is in the same folder or provide full path

Theory Explanation:

What the program does:
This Python program performs data preprocessing on the Iris dataset using the pandas and numpy libraries. It reads the dataset from a CSV file, displays basic information such as the first few rows and summary statistics, checks for missing values, and converts the categorical 'species' column into numerical format using label encoding.

Key operations of the program:
1. Importing necessary libraries (pandas, numpy).
2. Reading the dataset from a CSV file.
3. Displaying the first few rows of the dataset for initial inspection.
4. Checking for missing values to ensure data completeness.
5. Generating descriptive statistics to understand the distribution and range of features.
6. Showing the shape (rows and columns) of the dataset.
7. Displaying the data types of each column.
8. Performing label encoding to convert the categorical 'species' column into a numeric format which is essential for machine learning models.

Observations/Conclusions:
- The dataset appears to be well-structured and clean, with no missing values.
- Descriptive statistics provide a good overview of the feature distribution.
- Label encoding has successfully transformed the 'species' column into numeric form, which is useful for further analysis or modeling.
- The processed dataframe is now ready for use in machine learning tasks such as classification or clustering.
